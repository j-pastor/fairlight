# Fairlight PC-Port

PC port of *Fairlight – A Prelude* and *Fairlight II – A Trail of Darkness* developed with Godot.

---

## About the project

This project is a **PC port of the classic isometric adventure games *Fairlight – A Prelude* and *Fairlight II – A Trail of Darkness***, originally released for 8-bit systems in the mid-1980s.

The port has been developed **from scratch**, with all the programming work carried out specifically for this version, with the aim of:

- Preserving and showcasing *Fairlight – A Prelude* and *Fairlight II – A Trail of Darkness* for modern platforms  
- Making both games accessible on current operating systems  
- Allowing fans and developers to explore, study, and experiment with the code  
- Contributing to the preservation and dissemination of two important historical titles  

Fairlight – A Prelude and Fairlight II – A Trail of Darkness were originally developed in the 1980s for 8-bit home computers, including ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amstrad PCW and Commodore 64. Both games are considered landmark titles of the isometric adventure genre, notable for their advanced game engine, systemic design, and technical ambition on very limited hardware.

For reference and historical context, full walkthroughs of the original games can be found online:

- Fairlight II – A Trail of Darkness (original version): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK3L46D6S7A

A video showing the final result of this PC port is also available online: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhGVymi0Aoo . This video demonstrates the current state of the project, including gameplay, visuals, and overall behaviour of the PC port.
